# file inpur and output
"""
The random-access memory is volatile, and all its contents are lost once a program
terminates. In order to persist the data forever, we use files.

A file is data stored in a storage device. A python program can talk to the file by reading
content from it and writing content to it

There are 2 types of files:
1. Text files (.txt, .c, etc)
2. Binary files (.jpg, .dat, etc)
Python has a lot of functions for reading, updating, and deleting files.

# open("filename", "mode of opening(read mode by default)")
open("this.txt", "r")  # open file in read mode
open("this.txt", "w")  # open file in write mode
open("this.txt", "a")  # open file in append mode
open("this.txt", "r+")  # open file in read and write mode

# reading from a file
f = open("this.txt", "r")
data = f.read()  # read the whole file

MODES OF OPENING A FILE
r – open for reading
w - open for writing
a - open for appending
+ - open for updating.
‘rb’ will open for read in binary mode.
‘rt’ will open for read in text mode.
